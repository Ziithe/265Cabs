A Taxi Booking Flutter Application for Malawi

This product is a taxi booking Application to be built for 2 main users: Drivers and Passengers. 

 --> Drivers will use this application to find customers (aka passengers). To do this, drivers will show availability of their car by changing their status once logged in, enter seat number and mode of pick up.

 --> Passengers will use this car to find and book for taxis. They will be given the option of booking different types of vehicles (group, transit and private), and also schedule a booking for that moment or later. 

All users of this product will have to create and log in to their accounts to access services beyond the landing page.
